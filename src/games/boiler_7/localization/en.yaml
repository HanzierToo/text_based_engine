  arrival:
    dock: >
      The river fog hangs low over Dock 17.
      Boiler 7's exhaust tower cuts through the mist like a blade.
      The district depends on this unit. If it fails, half the lower wards go dark.
      Your inspection orders are stamped urgent.

  floor:
    main: >
      The boiler floor trembles beneath rotating pistons and hissing valves.
      Workers move with deliberate efficiency, but conversations stop when you pass.
      Pressure gauges along the far wall flicker slightly above normal range.

    valve: >
      The auxiliary pressure manifold is partially disassembled.
      A heavy brass valve key rests on a maintenance hook.
      No one seems eager to claim responsibility.

    worker: >
      A soot-streaked machinist glances at your badge, then away.
      After a pause, they lean closer.
      "The readings started spiking three nights ago.
      Management says it's drift.
      It isn't drift."

    main_worker_warning: >
      The machinist's warning lingers in your thoughts.

  control:
    entry: >
      The control room overlooks the boiler core through reinforced glass.
      Brass levers line the console.
      The central pressure needle vibrates against its housing.

    logs: >
      The maintenance ledger shows repeated recalibrations filed and overwritten.
      Several entries are signed, then crossed out.
      Someone adjusted tolerance limits upward.

    entry_tampering_found: >
      The falsified calibration logs shift your perception of the room.

  lower:
    entrance: >
      The lower chamber radiates dry heat.
      Steam condenses along the iron ribs of the chamber walls.
      The primary regulator housing groans under strain.

    no_valve_key_hint: >
      Without the proper valve key, any manual adjustment would be reckless.

    no_tampering_hint: >
      Nothing here immediately suggests deliberate interference.
      It could still be mechanical fatigue.

    stabilize: >
      You slot the valve key into the regulator assembly.
      A controlled counterturn releases trapped pressure in measured bursts.
      The chamber's vibration eases, though the system remains fragile.

    tampering: >
      Behind the regulator casing, a calibration stop has been filed down.
      Not worn.
      Filed.
      The boiler was forced to tolerate higher pressure than design allowed.

    valve_ready: >
      With the valve key in hand, manual adjustment is possible.

    entrance_suspicion: >
      Knowing the regulator was altered changes the meaning of every vibration.

  conclusion:
    final: >
      Boiler 7 stabilizes under your intervention.
      The district lights will hold tonight.
      What follows depends on what you choose to report.

    neutral: >
      You file a technical summary.
      No accusations.
      No names.
      The Guild will review internally.

    worker_trust: >
      You attach documentation of the tampering.
      The machinists will know someone listened.
      The Guild will not appreciate the implication.

    isolated: >
      You restrict your report to mechanical anomalies.
      Quietly.
      Whatever this was, it will remain buried.

    end: >
      The report is sealed and filed.
      Boiler 7 will hold — for now.
      Whatever forces strained the regulator remain outside the scope of your duty.
      The district sleeps with its lights intact.
