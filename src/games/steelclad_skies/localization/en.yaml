  ### PROLOGUE SCENE 1 | AWAKE - BEDROOM ###
  awake:
    intro: >
      The hums of the giant engines roar across the cabin room. Somethings afoot.
      The humming is different today–quieter and less distinct.
      You awake and check your notice-board for updates.

    notice_board: >
      General Notice — Between 0100 and 1300 the following events will occur today:
      Engine #5 maintenance —
      Junction Station #3 maintenance —
      Propellers #15 – #20 maintenance —
      Remain Vigilant. Remain Ready. The Ministry Appreciates You.

    make_ready: >
      That explains the difference of sound. You get ready for the day,
      cleaning yourself with wet cloths and your precious allocation of clean water.
      You use it sparingly, it's all you'll have for the week.
      If you do well enough today you might be able to afford soap at
      the provisions exchange today. You hang the cloths to dry and put on your
      work clothes for the day

    look_around: >
      It's your room, though claiming it's yours isn't quite right.
      Rusted steel walls and flooring provide that industrial smell
      you're so familiar with.
      The only objects of interest are your standard-issue gas mask and taskbook.
      There are no windows–you had your access to them revoked last month due to poor behaviour.
      The hanging cloths from today and yesterday stink up the room,
      though the exhaust vent helps a bit.

    take_stuff: >
      You take your gas mask–hopefully today you won't need it.
      You take your taskbook.

  ### PROLOGUE SCENE 2 | CORRIDOR ###
  corridor:
    intro: >
      You crank the wheel on your large water-tight steel door.
      It's strange how an airship like this would be designed to use these bulky,
      water-tight doors. You never bothered to question it though, you never had the time.
      The door creaks open slowly as you pull it inwards to reveal the dimly-lit corridor.
      Opposite to you is the room of another of your cabin mates, and the corridor is
      littered with doors similar to your own.

    see_signs: >
      Slightly to your right, hanging from the ceiling, is a series of crude and barely
      legible signs. The text on them you're all too familiar with.

    read_signs: >
      The signs read:
    
    sign_1: >
      ◀ MUNITIONS STORAGE BULKHEAD ◀

    sign_2: >
      ▲ OFFICERS QUARTERS | EXIT ▲

    sign_3: >
      ▶ CANTEEN | MEDICAL BAY ▶

    munition_prompt: >
      Looking at your taskbook, you can see that you're still missing your service
      rifle and alotted ammunition for the day. You should head to the armory in the
      bulkead munitions storage and see the quartermaster for your weapon.

    first_aid_prompt: >
      Now that you have your weapon, the last equipment you'll need today is your personal
      first-aid kit. The one you have on you is several years old and is likely useless
      or expired, particularly the chemicals. It'd be wise to go see the field medics about
      renewing or replacing your kit. However, there's no harm in arriving to work early.
      You haven't had to use your weapon or first-aid kit since you enlisted.

    tried_left_again: >
      There's not much of interest in the munitions storage anymore. Better to move along
      than be late. You wouldn't want to upset the officers.
  
  ### PROLOGUE SCENE 2.1 | MUNITIONS STORAGE ###
  munitions:
    intro: >
      You walk into the dimly lit bulkhead storage room. In front of your are
      countless numbers of crates and racks containing munitions for the weapons
      of the ships. To your left you see a small sectioned-off room which bears a
      crudely written and maintained sign labelled "Crewman Armory". Boxes are strewn
      about haphazardly and with little thought in organization.

    inspect_crates: >
      The big wooden crates are stamped with the seal of the ministry, along with some
      text underneath indicating what they contain. The large, wide and narrow boxes
      contain cannon shells, and the more box-shaped crates seem to contain small arms
      ammunition and other paraphernalia. Nothing you wouldn't expect outside of munitions
      storage, bar the sole exception of a row of black crates not labelled and locked with
      padlocks and guarded by two unamused looking guards. At least, you think they're
      unamused. You can't tell since their steel masks and black-and-gold uniforms hide
      any semblance of humanity.

    inspect_crates_again: >
      You get a closer look at the crates and see some labels that catch your attention.
      "Shot, A.P.D.S., 17-pr., Mk II", "Shell, H.E., 6-pr., Mk IV, Fuze 130".
      You have no idea what any of those mean. And even if you did, it wouldn't matter
      since you're not part of the artillery corps. Before you could find any more riveting
      crates to inspect, the quartermaster warns you not to go any further in case the
      ministry's sentries catch wind of you beyond your allowed access.

    speak_to_quartermaster: >
      You head over to the armory and speak to the quartermaster.

    quartermaster_dialogue_1: >
      "There you are. Your rifle's in its usual place, third rack, fourth from the bottom.
      Here's your ammo. I wouldn't go hunting if I were you *chuckle*. Oh and your bayonet's
      already attached to the rifle. I know how much you love taking that thing off."

    quartermaster_dialogue_2a: >
      "No worries mate. I made sure to polish that barrel band you was whinging about yesterday.
      Let me know if you see anything else that needs fixing, though maintaining it is really
      your responsibility."

    quartermaster_dialogue_2b: >
      "Late? Mate you are the only bastard here dumb enough to wake up early. If it weren't
      for you I'd still be asleep. Kidding of course, the Lieutenant would kill me."
    
    goodbye_qm_a: >
      You wave goodbye to J."

    goodbye_qm_b: >
      You wave goodbye to J, followed by a cursory exchange of insults, slowly morphing your
      wave into a middle finger. "Wanker."

    gas_mask:
      name: "Gas Mask"
      description: "Standard issue from the ministry. It reeks of sulfur and sweat."

    taskbook:
      name: "Taskbook"
      description: "Notes and tasks scribbled from previous assignments on days past litter the book's pages."

    ### PROLOGUE SCENE 2.1 | MUNITIONS STORAGE ###
    service_rifle:
      name: "Service Rifle"
      description: >
        Your trusty .303 service rifle. God knows when or where it came from. The wood's been
        polished to a shine, but you can see the visible markings of age and rot beneath the
        surface finish.

    service_rifle_ammunition:
      name: "Service Rifle Ammunition"
      description: >
        Loose rounds in a sheath of wax-paper. The brass is worn and has seen better days.
        You've only got so many rounds. It's been decades since the last war, or so the ministry
        says. These won't win you a war, or even a battle, but it's better than nothing.

    service_bayonet:
      name: "Service Bayonet"
      description: >
        In surprisingly good condition, considering the age of everything else. The blade is
        sharp, well-kept, and shows no sign of age or wear-and-tear, only the slight
        discoloration of the leather-strip handle would clue you in to the age of the thing.
